# getting-started-with-python
This repository contains my journey through the Advanced Programming with Python course. Iâ€™ll document my progress, share code snippets, and explore Pythonâ€™s powerful features. Letâ€™s dive into the world of Python excellence! ðŸš€

# Classes and Objects

Objects contain instance variables and methods that define their functionalities, which can only be invoked when associated ("self" - the first parameter is the current object).
Classes contain static variables and static methods, invoked by the class itself.

## Visibility of variables:

double underscore __: PRIVATE - highly encapsulated, not visible to other classes or modules - ex: self.__name
a single underscore _: PROTECTED - attribute should not be accessed outside the class (although it can happen) - ex: self._name
no underscore: PUBLIC - attribute can be accessed from anywhere in code - ex: self.name

Note: Although it's possible to hide variables, their manipulation by others is always possible.

## Access to variables:

reading - GETTER @property - ex: when we write 'person.name', we are calling the method name() defined by the decorator @property
assignment - SETTER (can include data validation) @Attribute.setter

Note: By using Getters and Setters we are following an important programming principle - Encapsulation. This allows the class to control how the attributes are accessed and modified. 

## Inheritance:
Hierarchy: superclass <- class <- subclass

Note: Python allows multiple inheritance - a class can derive from more than one superclass.
