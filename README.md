# getting-started-with-python
This repository contains my journey through the Advanced Programming with Python course. Iâ€™ll be documenting my progress, sharing code snippets, and exploring Pythonâ€™s powerful features. Letâ€™s dive into the world of Python excellence! ðŸš€

# Classes and Objects

Objects contain instance variables and instance methods that define their functionalities, which can only be invoked when associated ("self" - the first parameter is the current object).
Classes contain static variables and static methods, invoked by the class itself.

## Visibility of variables:

double underscore __: not visible to other classes or modules
a single underscore _:
no underscore: public

Note: Although it's possible to hide variables, their manipulation by others is always possible.

## Access to variables:

reading - GETTER @property
assignment - SETTER (can include data validation) @Attribute.setter

## Inheritance:
Hierarchy: superclass <- class <- subclass

Note: Python allows multiple inheritance - a class can derive from more than one superclass.
