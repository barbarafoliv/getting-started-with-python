# Getting Started with Python

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey through the Advanced Programming with Python course. Iâ€™ll be sharing my progress, code snippets, and the exploration of Pythonâ€™s powerful features. Let's dive into the world of Python excellence! ðŸš€

## Classes and Objects

In Python, objects contain instance variables and methods that define their functionalities. These can only be invoked when associated with the object itself (referred to as "self"). On the other hand, classes contain static variables and static methods, which are invoked by the class itself.

### Visibility of Variables

- **Private** (`__`): These are highly encapsulated variables that are not visible to other classes or modules. For example, `self.__name`.
- **Protected** (`_`): These attributes should not be accessed outside the class, although it can happen. For example, `self._name`.
- **Public**: These attributes can be accessed from anywhere in the code. For example, `self.name`.

> Note: Although it's possible to hide variables, their manipulation by others is always possible.

### Access to Variables

- **Getter** (`@property`): This is used for reading the variable. For example, when we write 'person.name', we are calling the method `name()` defined by the decorator `@property`.
- **Setter** (`@Attribute.setter`): This is used for assigning values to the variable. It can include data validation.

> Note: By using Getters and Setters we are following an important programming principle - Encapsulation. This allows the class to control how the attributes are accessed and modified.

## Inheritance

Inheritance in Python follows a hierarchy: `superclass <- class <- subclass`. Python also allows multiple inheritance, which means a class can derive from more than one superclass.
