# Dynamic Class Creation with Metaprogramming in Python

# 1. Method Definitions:
# init(self, language): Initialization method of the class, which takes an argument language and assigns it to the attribute self.language.
def init(self, language):
    self.language = language

# get_language(self): Method that returns the value of the attribute self.language.
def get_language(self):
    return self.language

# 2. Dynamic Class Creation:
# Use the type() function to dynamically create a new class called 'LanguageType'.
# The base class is object, indicated by (object, ).
# The third argument is a dictionary that maps method names to their implementations.
LanguageType = type('LanguageType', (object, ), {
    '__init__': init,      # Associates the init method with the class for initialization
    'get_language': get_language,    # Associates the get_language method with the class to obtain the value of language
})

# 3. Class Instance Creation:
# Create an instance of the 'LanguageType' class passing 'Python' as the value for the language argument.
# This triggers the initialization method __init__, which assigns 'Python' to the self.language attribute.
language_instance = LanguageType(language='Python')

# 4. Method get_language() Call:
# Call the get_language() method of the language_instance to obtain the value of the language attribute.
print(language_instance.get_language())  # Prints the value returned by the method, which should be 'Python'.
